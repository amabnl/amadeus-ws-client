# 2016-05

Completely re-worked the Result being returned by Web Service calls: the XML or PHP object is now encapsulated in an `Amadeus\Client\Result` object which makes checking for errors or warnings much easier. 

The library now always returns both the PHP object generated by `\SoapClient` as well as the result string. 

The Result object also has a `status` property which contains the status of the message performed: FATAL, OK, WARN or INFO. 

The library will now also convert `\SoapFault` exceptions to a FATAL result status. 

(https://github.com/amabnl/amadeus-ws-client/issues/2)

* Added support for providing custom `\SoapClient` options (https://github.com/amabnl/amadeus-ws-client/issues/4)

# UNSTABLE

The library's API will be unstable until we release the first version.

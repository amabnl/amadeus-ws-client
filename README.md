We currently support a full AIR booking flow with MasterPricer, including seat selection and ATC ticket changer flow, as well as a number of additional messages useful for automation. See the full list of supported messages [here](docs/list-of-supported-messages.rst).

# Purpose

This library makes it a lot easier for developers to integrate content from the Amadeus Web Services into their projects. It takes care of:

- Session management - setting the correct SOAP headers both for Soap Header 2 and 4.
- Supports all features of Soap Header 4 such as Stateful and Stateless messages.
- Building the correct request message based on the provided options: the library tries to simplify overly complex request structures where possible.
- Handling exceptions and checking for error messages in the response.
- Dealing with different versions of messages.
- Dealing with multiple WSDL files in a WSAP.

# Requirements

* PHP 8.1 or newer

## v1
